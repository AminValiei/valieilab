Continuous use of antibiotics is associated with side effects on the gut microbiome. In this project, we aim to develop strategies to minimize these effects. Each person's microbiome is unique and responds differently to antibiotic exposure. We seek to leverage both experimental and computational approaches to predict individual microbiome responses to antibiotics.
